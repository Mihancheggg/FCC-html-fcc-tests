            <p>Yuri Alekseyevich Gagarin[a] (9 March 1934 – 27 March 1968) was a Soviet pilot and cosmonaut 
                who became the first human to journey into outer space. Travelling in the Vostok 1 capsule, 
                Gagarin completed one orbit of Earth on 12 April 1961. By achieving this major milestone 
                in the Space Race he became an international celebrity, and was awarded many medals and titles, 
                including Hero of the Soviet Union, his nation's highest honour.
